# PMP - Process Monitor Parser

This is a work in progress project where we try to parse XML files.

It's aiming for a software named Process Monitor of the Sys Internal suite of Microsoft. This project can also be used to parse other kind of files than the ones Process Monitor outputs, but we target this specific software for now to have something to rely on for testing.

Feel free to help, there is some key components that do not work for now like:

- The REPL
- The Parser with

The elements that works:

- Lexer/tokenizer for basic XML data files.
